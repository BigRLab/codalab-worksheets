This means that the sensitivity (part of true nodules in all test scans detected by the system) is plotted as a function of the average number of false positive markers per scan. To obtain a point on the FROC curve, only those findings of a CAD system whose degree of suspicion is above a threshold <em>t</em> are selected, and the number of false positives and true positives is determined. All thresholds <em>t</em> that define a unique point on the FROC curve are evaluated. Between these points, straight lines are drawn to produce the FROC curve. The point with the lowest false positive rate is connected to (0,0). From the point with the highest false positive rate, the FROC curve is extended by a straight horizontal line.</p>\r\n<p>To extract a single score from the FROC curve, we measure the sensitivity at 7 predefined false positive rates: 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, and 8 FPs per scan. Note that since we connect points on the FROC with straight lines as outlined above, we can always exactly compute these sensitivities from the curve, even if there is no threshold <em>t</em> that precisely produces these false positive rates. These 7 sensitivities are averaged to obtain an overall score of a system. Clearly a perfect system will have a score of 1 and the lowest possible score is 0. Most CAD systems in clinical use today have their internal threshold set to operate somewhere between 1 to 4 false positives per scan on average (some systems allow the user to vary the threshold). To make the task more challenging, we included lower false positive rates in our evaluation. This determines if a system can also identify a significant percentage of nodules with very few false alarms, as might be needed for CAD algorithms that operate more or less autonomously.</p>\r\n<p>From the previous exposition, it should be clear that to obtain a good score, systems should include enough findings in their results to reach the point of 8 FPs per scan. It is probably also beneficial to include enough different values for the degree of suspicion to produce a decent number of unique points on the FROC curve. In the extreme case that all findings are assigned the same degree of suspicion, there will be only one point on the curve defined, and a straight line will be drawn from (0,0) to this point, and a horizontal line will extend from that point to the right. Finally, note that no more than 2000 findings will be processed. If a submitted result file contains more findings, they will be sorted on the supplied degrees of suspicion and findings not among the 2000 most suspicious will be discarded.</p>\r\n<h2>Format of the result file</h2>\r\n<p>The result file must be a simple ASCII readable text file that contains a string and four numbers per line. Each line holds one finding. The strings or numbers must be separated by spaces or tab characters.</p>\r\n<p>The string is the name of the scan in which the finding is located. Possible values for the string are test01, test02, ... , test50. This string is followed by 3 numbers giving the x, y, and z coordinates of the finding, respectively. They can be floating point values if desired (use a decimal point, not a comma). Note that the first voxel in the supplied data has coordinates (0,0,0). Coordinates are given in 'voxel coordinates', not in world coordinates or millimeters. You can verify if you use the correct way of addressing voxels by checking the supplied coordinates for the example data, the locations should refer to locations that hold a nodule.</p>\r\n<p>The final number is a degree of suspicion that should be higher for findings more likely to represent true nodules (can be a floating point value, use a decimal point in that case). The FROC curve of the system will be determined by thresholding this value.</p>\r\n<p>Between the strings and the numbers should be one or more spaces or tab characters. The order of the lines is irrelevant.</p>\r\n<p>The following is an example result file:</p>\r\n<pre>test07 108 212 254.443 0.313433\r\ntest20 228 234 106.316 0.791044\r\ntest14 94 328 316 0.432836\r\ntest41 218 298 109 561 0.238806\r\ntest04 388 156 363 0.432836\r\ntest04 182 401 238 0.865671\r\ntest08 330 306.8 148.8 0.820895\r\ntest01 116 124 45 0.373134\r\ntest15 194 208 312 0.507463\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>This file contains 9 findings (obviously way too few). There are 8 unique likelihood values. This means that there will be 8 unique thresholds that produce a distinct set of findings (each threshold discards finding below the threshold. That means there will be 8 points on the FROC curve.</p>\r\n<h2>How often can I submit results?</h2>\r\n<p>Teams can upload as often as they want, but all submitted results will appear on the website and should be substantially different from previous submissions. These differences must be evident from the submitted pdf description file. In other words, you cannot submit a long series of results, using the same pdf file. This is done to avoid clutter on the result page and to avoid 'training on the test set'.</p>\r\n<p>If you have developed a new algorithm, and you are already listed on the site with another system, you can either use the same team or create a new team for your new algorithm.</p>\r\n<p>Currently we do not offer the possibility for teams to remove submitted results. If you believe there are good reasons to remove certain results that you have submitted, please contact Bram van Ginneken (bram.vanginneken@raboudumc.nl).</p>\r\n<h2>Description of the algorithms; checklist</h2>\r\n<p>With every result file that is submitted on this website, a pdf file that describes the system that generated the results must be uploaded. Ideally this document is a paper (scientific publication or technical report) describing the system that has been used to generate the results in such detail that others can reimplement it.</p>\r\n<p>References to accessible literature in the description are also acceptable, there is no need to repeat information that can be found in such publications. If you have not yet written a detailed paper, or have submitted this for publication and do not want it to become publicly available yet, or if you have other reasons why you want to withhold detailed information about your method, please indicate the reasons for this in the pdf file you submit and describe the system only briefly, using the checklist given below. If your system is commercial and you do not want to divulge details, please provide whatever you can release, and state the name and the version of the system and the company that is associated with it.</p>\r\n<p>The reason we require the upload of a descriptive document with every submitted result is that we believe that it is far less interesting to report results of systems whose working is unknown. We reserve the right to not process results that are not accompanied by a suitable description.</p>\r\n<p>If desired you can change the pdf file that describes your system. Send the new pdf and the submission number (listed at the top of the result page) it applies to to Bram van Ginneken (bram.vanginneken@radboudumc.nl).</p>\r\n<p>For convenience, we provide a checklist below of items that we believe should be mentioned in a description of a CAD system for nodule detection in thoracic CT scans.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Does your system use training data, if so describe the characteristics of the training data.</li>\r\n<li>Give the overall structure of the algorithm.

The site will remain open and submitted results are dated, so improvements in CAD technology over time can be quantified.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Motivation for the study</h2>\r\n<p>There are several, related, reasons why we are organizing this study. One is that the competitive nature of this study may stimulate research groups to improve their algorithms, following the paradigm of <a href=\"http://www.xprize.org/\">revolution through competition</a>. Another one is that we believe progress in the development of computer-aided diagnosis systems is impeded by the fact that it is hard to compare the relative merits of different CAD systems and approaches when published performance measures are obtained on different data sets, and these data sets are not accessible to other researchers. The ANODE09 study allows a more direct comparison because the same data and the same evaluation procedure is used for all submitted results.</p>\r\n<p>The latter is the reason why the reference annotations for the test data cannot be downloaded, and will not be made available in the future. Previous experiences with making data sets publicly available have taught us that if we released the 'truth' for the test data, researchers would perform slightly or vastly different types of evaluations. It could also lead to data picking, i.e. reporting results on a subset of scans or nodules only. While different ways of evaluating algorithms exist for good reason, and while it may make perfect sense to apply an algorithm only to a subset of a database, all of this leads to incomparable results reported in papers, even though the same database was used. To avoid this, we decided on the current procedure, which ensures that each system is evaluated in exactly the same way.</p>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>", "competition": 7}, {"container": "Automatic Nodule Detection Challenge 2009 - None", "id": 21, "category": 2, "defaults": null, "codename": "get_data", "title": null, "label": "Get Data", "rank": 0, "visibility": true, "markup": "", "html": "<h2>Dataset details</h2>\r\n<p>For this study, 5 example scans and 50 test scans can be downloaded. There is no separate data set available to train algorithms. Of course you are also allowed to use your own training data for any algorithm you develop and apply to the ANODE09 test data set. However, you should <strong>not use the ANODE09 test data in any way for training your system</strong> as this would positively bias and thus invalidate your results.

Many programs, for example the free program <a href=\"http://www.7-zip.org\">7zip</a>, can do this.</p>\r\n<p>Each downloaded file contains original CT scans, stored in Meta format. This format stores an image as an ASCII readable header file with extension .mhd and a separate binary file for the image data with extension .raw. This format is ITK compatible; documentation is available <a href=\"http://www.itk.org/Wiki/MetaIO\">here</a>. An application that can read the data is <a href=\"http://www.itksnap.org/\">SNAP</a>. If you want to write your own code to read the data, note that in the header file you can find the dimensions of the scan, and the voxel spacing. In the raw file the values for each voxel are stored consecutively with index running first over x, then y, then z. The pixel type is short.</p>\r\n<p>The annotation file that is distributed with the example scans is an ASCII readable text file that contains one finding per line. Each line holds the scan name (example01 to example05); the x, y, and z coordinate of each finding in voxels; and the type of finding (1 for a true nodule, 2 for a finding that is not a relevant nodule according to the protocol used in the screening study from which the data originates, but that may represent a lesion.
